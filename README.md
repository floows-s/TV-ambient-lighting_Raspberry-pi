# amb_led_tv_V2

I working again on this project but now i am also finishing it... I want to rewrite all my code so might as well just open a new repo. The other repo is not that important and could be deleted if not needed anymore. This repo will hold the most recent code.


## Real readme

This is meant for the linux (this includes raspberry pi).
Made with openCV 4.x


### Instalation
Run the script "setup.sh" in the "Install" folder to do the following:
- Runs "install_opencv.sh" which:
    - Installs cmake, g++, wget and unzip
    - Install and build the opencv lib.
- Builds the project code.
- TODO: Optionally add the cron-job service for startup
